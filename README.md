## 03)AI-Driven, Field-Specific Interview Simulation

The AI Interview Coach offers smart, adaptive interview practice tailored to the user’s career interests and target field. When a user specifies their desired role or industry (e.g., Software Engineering, Marketing, Data Science, Teaching), the AI dynamically generates interview questions relevant to that field.

### How It Works

- **User Input:**  
  Upon starting a session, users are prompted to select or type their target job role or field.
- **Custom Question Generation:**  
  The AI uses this input to generate realistic, field-appropriate interview questions—from technical topics to behavioral scenarios.
- **Adaptive Follow-Ups:**  
  Based on the user’s answers, the AI asks follow-up questions, simulating a real interviewer in that specific field.
- **Specialized Feedback:**  
  Feedback and sample answers are customized for the selected role, helping users understand industry expectations.

### Example

- If a user selects “Software Developer,” questions might include coding challenges, system design, or problem-solving scenarios.
- If a user selects “Marketing,” questions might focus on campaign strategies, analytics, or creativity.
- For “Teaching,” questions could address classroom management, lesson planning, or student engagement.

### Benefits

- **Personalized Practice:**  
  Users get targeted practice for their chosen career path.
- **Real-World Preparation:**  
  Simulated interviews mirror actual questions and scenarios from the field.
- **Confidence Building:**  
  Field-specific feedback helps users feel prepared for a variety of professional interviews.
